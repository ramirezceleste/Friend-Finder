# Friend-Finder

Instructions

Your survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.

The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.

The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
